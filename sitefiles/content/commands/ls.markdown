**ls** lists files (and folders, symlinks, etc) 

Run with no options, **ls** will list the files in the current directory, laid out in columns. (The exact number of columns depends on the width of the terminal window and the length of the filenames being listed.) **ls** is meant to be human readable, 

By default, it lists the files in your current working directory but it can list them everywhere. It's a pretty simple command, but essential to getting around the filesystem from the terminal.
