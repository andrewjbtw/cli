**md5sum** is a tool that creates md5 checksums (or hashes, if that's your preferred term). It can also verify checksums from a list.

**md5sum** is one of a family of checksum tools that differ only in name and algorithm. If **md5sum** is installed on your system, you are likely to also have:

**sha256sum**<br>
**sha512sum**

and a few others. I mention these other tools for a few reasons:

1. They work just like md5sum, so everything I see here should work with the other tools simply by replacing the command name with the one you want.
2. The md5 algorithm has been broken for security purposes for a long time, and you probably shouldn't use it. If you have a choice (i.e. are not working with legacy tools or data), you should use a stronger hash.

#### Obligatory discliamer on the brokenness of md5 ####

The first thing you're likely to hear at this point if you tell someone with a computing background that you're using md5 is that "md5 is broken" and you shouldn't use it. I guess I've also already done that too above. "Broken" means that it's possible to generate so-called hash collisions, where two different files have the same md5 checksum. Since one of the principle uses of a checksum algorithm is to provide a way to uniquely identify files using unique hashes generated for each file, an algorithm that can't guarantee uniqueness isn't a particularly useful algorithm.

But if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're stuck using md5 for some reason. Maybe you're using an application that generates checksums but only supports md5. I can think of at least one media asset management system that does this, and it's not even an old piece of software. So the only way to verify the checksums generated by that system is to use md5. Or maybe you're working with a set of data where someone previously generated md5 checksums and now you want to verify them.

I've been in both situations while working in digital archives contexts, so I've ended up using md5 a lot. But I've been seeing it as an intermediate step towards storing files with stronger hashes like sha256.

#### Generating checksums ####

**md5sum** can be run interactively (sort of), with input from a pipe, and with input as a file. The output will always be an md5 hash followed by one or two spaces and then a filename. Note that the filename will be '-' if the input to**md5sum**came from standard input in the form of a pipe or terminal.

*Interactive use*

To run **md5sum** interactively, simply type

```bash
$ md5sum
```

This will put **md5sum** into interactive mode where you can type some text and have **md5sum** generate an md5 hash for what you typed. To tell **md5sum** that you're done typing, press CTRL+D. If you press Enter instead of CTRL+D, **md5sum** will treat that as part of the input (as a "newline" character), so you have to type CTRL+D to signal that you're done.

Consider the word "dog" followed by "Enter":

```bash
$ md5sum
dog
362842c5bb3847ec3fbdecb7a84a8692  -
```

Now compare that with the word "dog" not followed by anything.
```bash
$md5sum
dog06d80eb0c50b49a509b49f2424e8c805  -
```

The **md5sum** output here is a bit hard to read because there's no line break, but you can see that the hash that immediately follows "dog" is different than the hash in the example where I typed "Enter" before ending input.

*Input from a pipe*

You can also achieve the same result - and more - by sending input to md5sum from a pipe.

```bash
$ echo "dog" | md5sum
362842c5bb3847ec3fbdecb7a84a8692  -
```

Note that the md5 value above is actually the same as the one generated interactively by typing "dog" and then "Enter". This is because **echo** prints a newline by default.

If you use the '-n' option to **echo**, which suppresses the newline, the result is the same as the second interactive result above:

```bash
$ echo -n "dog" | md5sum
06d80eb0c50b49a509b49f2424e8c805  -
```

Sending input to **md5sum** isn't limited to text. You can also just send bytes. This leads to some odd looking constructs like generating a checksum from an optical disk by "reading" the disk directly from the drive into md5sum:

```bash
$ cat /media/cdrom | md5sum
# I don't actually have an optical drive at the moment to show the output here.
# But it would look like any other md5sum output from a pipe.
```

*Input as a file*

Most of the time if I'm generated a checksum, it's for a file. This is pretty simple: just type **md5sum** followed by a path to a file.
